# Linear-Regression-for-Machine-Learning
Predicting the prices of the houses with the help of housing data for the city of Ames, Iowa, United States from 2006 to 2010. Dataset was downloaded from https://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock/AmesHousing.txt.
The linear regression model is build using feature engineering and feature selection techniques.
The main highlight of this model is the use of categorical variables for prediction. It can be observed that the lowest RMSE value is obtained when we use numerical attributes along side the categorical attributes.
